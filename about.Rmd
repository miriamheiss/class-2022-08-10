## About me!

I'm [Miriam Heiss](https://www.miriamheiss.com/), and this is a website that I made for a [class](https://bootcamp.davidkane.info/). I play the organ, make soap, and occasionally sew! 

## About this project!

The data for this project came from [Opportunity Insights](https://opportunityinsights.org/data/). It is about the Economic Connectedness of counties around the United States.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

### What should the project show?

The graphs that are included should show counties in the United States, and how connected to the economy they are, with factors such as population, and economy.
